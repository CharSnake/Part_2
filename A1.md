## App 1: Simplii

  
    The first application I'll talk about is the Simplii banking app. This app was released in 2014, but with the change from PC Financial to Simplii in 2017 bringing a big update, this could be considered an entire new app. The app allows banking through a mobile device, as would be expected, but does so in a very easy to navigate way. It doesn't do as much as you would expect from the regular website, but enough to get something done quickly on your phone. I chose this app because although it is simple, it still brings a lot of use, especially with its mobile deposit feature.
	
    The main reasons someone would download this app so that they can access their bank on the go. Sometimes being able to view your funds, make a transfer or payment, or depositing a cheque is something you can't do in the middle of nowhere, but the app helps you. This is especially true for the previously mentioned mobile deposit. The app's technologies are relatively simple, providing a simple interface without many interesting details. However, the camera is utilized along with text recognition to read cheques, and good connections with their servers to provide quick service.
	
    One of the main strengths are the app's simple, easy to navigate menus. You're never more than a few clicks away for whatever you want to navigate to, usually taking two clicks, or three at the most, to reach your destination. Another great strength is the ability to deposit cheques online, especially if you aren't at a location to reach a bank, or simply don't want to head out. A weakness that this app has is that it might be a little bit *too* simple. The website has almost every feature the app has (excluding mobile deposit) and more, so if you're more stay at home, then the app will have much less use. One improvement I would suggest is to add more features to the app, at least the ones that provide you with information. This could bring more people to using the app instead of logging on to the web page.
	

## App 2: Armory & Machine


    The second application is called Armory & Machine. This app is a game, but still brings some interesting things. It's an idle game, meaning that there's a bit of waiting around, but there are also many active elements as well. There's management mechanics, story mechanics, and a hint of MMO as you collect items to unlock more and more features. You start out with a single feature, and as you unlock more, the amount of depth slowly increases. The reason I chose this is because it shows that you can take good things from many different sources and make something that feels unique, without overwhelming the user.
	
    The reason someone would want to use this app is if they are the type of person who only somewhat likes idle games, but they don't like sitting around all day. With this game, there is usually always something you can do, and with the exploration mechanic, eventually there is ALWAYS something to do. Slowly unlocking bits and pieces of the story (Why are you here? What is this machine even doing here?) is another reason for someone to want to use the app, as they discover more and more. There aren't many technologies used in this app, as it also has a pretty simple interface to use. It does utilize WiFi for the advertisements, which can be viewed for bonuses, but this is completely optional and not common.
	
    The main strengths of this app are its game-play and speed. The game feels satisfying when you finally reach the point where you unlock a new feature, skill, or bonus. There's no real rush needed as well. And while the same itself is relatively simple, some of the features, such as managing your workers or combat against certain enemies, requires a decent amount of planning. Plus, everything is laid out, so there are no surprises. The story is a nice added touch, adding a little something special to an otherwise good game. Some weaknesses are that the pace of the game may be a little slow at the start, especially regarding workers. Additionally, while this may not come up often, not playing for a while may make coming back somewhat disorienting if you're already far into the game, with the lack of help or information.
